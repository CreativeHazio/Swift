# Swift
A tech tailored news app for techies that wants to get latest news on business and tech trends

## My Story
I started learning how to program about three years ago. After mastering the basics enough to build something, my friend and I decided to collaborate on an app. At that time, we had no idea what AI or ChatGPT was because we lived in a third-world country where the latest tech arrives much later and often outdated.

While searching for app ideas, we stumbled upon ChatGPT and the AI art craze. Companies like Lensa and early adopters were already generating thousands and millions of dollars from this trend. As we started, our app felt like a small fish in a vast ocean. (You can check out the AI art app here: https://github.com/CreativeHazio/krAitor).

I felt a mix of anger and realization. I understood that whoever gets their hands on information first profits the most. This insight inspired me to create an information app dedicated to feeding users with only tech and business-related news. We made sure it was affordable, enabling a wide range of users to access it.

## This app was born from a desire to always be updated with the latest tech trends and not get distracted with other unimportant news hence the name "Swift".
The app is still in its development stage but features to be expected are:
##### ðŸ’ Users can comment on an article for other users to see and learn from.
##### ðŸ’ Users can save multiple articles to be read later in offline mode.
##### ðŸ’ Users can write articles and eventually start getting paid doing so.
##### ðŸ’ AI to recommend news
##### ðŸ’ Affordable as a monthly subscription app.
